            <h2>Your life is a highlight reel,</h2>

            <p>a gradual search for a handful of memories. We like to think that every moment has potential, that there’s something transcendent hidden all around, that if you’d only stop to seize the day, you could hold onto it and carry it with you. But the truth is, most of life is forgotten instantly, almost as it’s happening. Chances are that even a day like today will slip through your fingers and dissolve into oblivion, washed clean by the tides.</p>

            <p>Such is the rhythm of ordinary time: the featureless stretches between one memory and the next, the thousand acts of maintenance you do every day. You keep your body going, hauling it back and forth from one place to the next. You breathe in and out. Things fall apart, you clean up the mess. And it all washes away in the night, to be built up again in the morning. You throw the week against the wall to see what sticks, hoping you will remember something that happened today, anything.</p>

            <p>Most of our lives are spent in the hinterlands, the empty stretches we fly over to get to the good parts. And you wonder how you could spend so much time just pushing back against the current, trying to keep your small boat afloat, watching for a glimmer on the horizon, waiting for those moments when you can finally say, eureka! “I’ve found it!”</p>

            <p>But it’s all happening—it’s all real—whether you’ll remember it or not. So you might as well say ol?ka!—"I've lost it!"—as if to mark the passage of yet another opportunity, flushed down the hourglass. A final toast to the endless forgotten days, whose humble labor has given you everything you have, at least for the moment.</p>

            <p>As the song says: long live the high tide and long live the low, but above all, long live the difference.</p>

            <h1>Onism</h2>

            <h6>The Awareness of How Little of the World You'll Experience</h6>

            <p>Portmanteau of monism + onanism. <br /><br /> 
                
                In philosophy, monism is the view that a variety of things can be explained in terms of a single reality or substance, or a distinct source. Onism is a kind of monism, because your life is indeed limited to a single reality—by virtue of being restricted to a single body—but something is clearly missing. <br /><br /> 
                
                Meanwhile, onanism is another word for self-pleasure, transfixed inside your own menagerie of fantasies like going on a sightseeing tour your own apartment—frustrating in its closed-off familiarity. Again, something is missing.

            <h2>You are here.</h2>
            <p>
              You were lost at first, but soon began sketching yourself a map of the world—plotting the contours of your life.</p>

              <p>And like the first explorers, sooner or later you have to contend with the blank spaces on the map. All the experiences you've never had. The part of you still aching to know what's out there. Eventually these questions take on a weight of their own, and begin looming over your everyday life.</p>

              <p>All the billions of doors you had to close in order to take a single step forward. All the things you haven't done and may never get around to doing; all the risks that may or may not have been real; all the destinations you didn't buy a ticket to; all the lights you see in the distance that you can only wonder about; all the alternate histories you narrowly avoided; all the fantasies that stay dormant inside your head; everything you're giving up, to be where you are right now; the questions that you wrongly assumed were unanswerable.</p>

              <p>It's strange how little of the universe we actually get to see. Strange how many assumptions we have to make just to get by, stuck in only one body, in only one place at a time. Strange how many excuses we've invented to explain why so much of life belongs in the background. Strange that any of us could ever feel at home on such an alien world.</p>

              <p>We sketch monsters on the map because we find their presence comforting. They guard the edges of the abyss, and force us to look away; so we can live comfortably in the Known World, at least for a little while.</p>

              <p>But if someone were to ask you on your deathbed what it was like to live here on Earth, perhaps the only honest answer would be, "I don't know. I passed through it once, but I've never really been there.</p>

          <h1>Kenopsia</h1>
          <h6>The Eeriness of Places Left Behind</h6>
          <p>kenopsia, n. <br /><br />
            The eerie, forlorn atmosphere of a place that’s usually bustling with people but is now abandoned and quiet—a school hallway in the evening, an unlit office on a weekend, vacant fairgrounds—an emotional afterimage that makes it seem not just empty but hyper-empty, with a total population in the negative, who are so conspicuously absent they glow like neon signs.</p>

      <section class="module content">
        <div class="container">
          <h2>You can sense it when you move out of a house,</h2>

          <p>noticing just how empty a place can feel. 
            Walking through a school hallway in the evening, 
            or an unlit office on a weekend, 
            fairgrounds out of season. 
            It's usually bustling with life, 
            but now lies abandoned and quiet.
          </p>
            
          <p> It's easy to forget that most of your memories happened in places that are still around,
            the walls mostly unchanged, 
            with even some of the same people, 
            who carry on in your absence.
            But the world you once knew, 
            and the people you still remember,
            have long since moved on, 
            replaced by so many others who have passed through these doors.
          </p>

          <p>You try to stick around long enough to catch up with the memories,
            to finally linger in the life you spend so much time building up,
            hoping the world will stick around to keep you company.
            But eventually you'll pack up your things 
            and walk through the house one last time. 
          </p>

          <p>And not a day after you leave, it'll become someone else's new   home, a blank canvas they'll fill up with their own memories. burying the life you built in a fresh coat of paint, leaving nothing but echoes of what was once here.</p>
            
          <p>Leaving the room not just empty but hyper-empty. 
            with a total population in the negative, 
            whose inhabitants are so conspicuously absent they glow like neon signs. 
          </p>
            
          <p>Maybe that's why we want to believe in ghosts.
            Maybe it's just a fantasy. 
            A fantasy that our memories are so powerful they'll leave a mark on the wall
            that would mean something to someone else, 
            and can't just be painted over.
          </p>

          <p>We just want to mark our time here, 
            to keep the rooms filled and the memories alive. 
            And if our houses are haunted, 
            it'll be because we're haunting them ourselves,
            as if there was ever such a thing as unfinished business.
